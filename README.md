# 🖼️ Image-Filtering

This repository contains two projects where we developed a **parallelizable and scalable image filter**.

## 📜 Project Overview
1. **Basic Version**:
   - We applied filters to images and then **reconstructed** them to ensure the filters were working properly.
   
2. **CUDA Version**:
   - We transformed the initial implementation using the **CUDA library** to enable the code to run on a **dedicated GPU**, significantly improving performance and making the process much faster.

Both versions demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the filtering system.
